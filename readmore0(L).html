<center><h1>Corona:A Pandemic</h1></center>
<p>The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first noted in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized it as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 6 April 2020, more than 1,270,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over 200 countries and territories,resulting in approximately 69,400 deaths.More than 260,000 people have recovered.

The virus is mainly spread during close contact,and by small droplets produced during coughing,[d] sneezing, or talking.These small droplets may also be produced during breathing, but rapidly fall to the ground or surfaces and are not generally spread through the air over large distances.People may also catch COVID-19 by touching a contaminated surface and then their face. The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.It is most contagious during the first 3 days after symptom onset, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.The time between exposure and symptom onset is typically around five days, but may range from 2 to 14 days.Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.

Efforts to prevent the virus spread include travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls, event postponements and cancellations, and facility closures. These include national or regional quarantines throughout the world (starting with the quarantine of Hubei), curfew measures in mainland China,various border closures or incoming passenger restrictions,screening at airports and train stations, and outgoing passenger travel bans.

The pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic disruption,the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, and cultural events,and widespread fears of supply shortages resulting in panic buying.Schools and universities have closed either on a nationwide or local basis in more than 160 countries, affecting approximately 97 percent of the world's student population. Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and others from hotspots.

<p><u><b>Epidemiology</b></u></p>
<p>Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.The cases mostly had links to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and so the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin.The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses,pangolin coronaviruses,and SARS-CoV.

The earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster.Of the early cluster of cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to have a link with the market.On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case traced back to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old from Hubei province, may have been the first.

On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that, as new cases reportedly declined in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases within China for the first time.There may be substantial underreporting of cases, particularly among those with milder symptoms.By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among youths, with those 19 and under making up 2.4% of cases worldwide.

Government sources in Germany and the United Kingdom estimate that 60–70% of the population will need to become infected before effective herd immunity can be achieved.</p>
