<b><p class="p1">Hello Everyone,</p></b>
<i><p class="p2"><sub>I am Mananjay and I am going to introduce you all with <br>my team members Rhythem and Sudhangini who altogether<br> worked on this project. We are first-year students of bachelor<br> of technology in Computer Science Engineering department <br>in Lovely Professional University. We were assigned a project<br> to create a blog website and as we know blogs are nothing but <br>the information in reverse chronological order, In this project <br>we have created a blog website and included some of the news<br> which were recent at the time of creation. We used HTML, CSS <br>and JAVASCRIPT in this project. In this website you can read the <br>blogs with logging in or without logging in.<br><br>
