   <p class="p1">The US intelligence community has determined that the Chinese government concealed the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in China and gave false statistics of the total number of positive cases and deaths in the country.</p>
   <p class="p2">Intelligence officials transmitted a classified report of their findings to the White House last week. Sources told Bloomberg that the main conclusion of the report is that China's public reporting of coronavirus cases is "intentionally incomplete." One official told the outlet the intelligence document found that China's numbers are fake.</p>
   <p class="p3">China was the center of the novel coronavirus outbreak until recently, when the number of US cases surpassed China's. The World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus, which causes a disease known as COVID-19, a pandemic on March 11.</p>
   <p class="p4">As of April 1, 885,687 people across the globe have been infected and 44,216 have died.</p>
   <p class="p5">China has publicly reported 82,361 confirmed cases and 3,316 deaths, according to a database from the Johns Hopkins University. Comparatively, the US has 190,089 positive cases and 4,102 deaths, and it is now the global epicenter of the outbreak.</p>
   <p class="p6">The novel coronavirus outbreak originated in China's Hubei province in the city of Wuhan. As more and more people began getting sick, China's communist government implemented strict lockdown procedures and ordered residents to stay inside while officials raced to contain the spread of the virus. </p>
   <p class="p7">Bloomberg reported that there's been significant doubt of China's reported statistics on its coronavirus cases, and that the Chinese government has repeatedly changed its methodology to track cases.</p>
