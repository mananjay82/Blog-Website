 <p> 02 April 2020 Current Affairs : The <b>Reserve Bank of India (RBI)</b> has announced relief measures for <b>state governments, exporters.</b> The Central Bank also provides relief to banks' capital concerns. <br><br>

<b><u>RBI Measures:</u></b><br><br>
<b>1)</b> RBI extended the deadline for realization and repatriation period of export which is made up to or on <b>31 July</b>.The period of export has been relaxed for up to 15 <br>months from 9 months (at present). 
The move by RBI will enable exporters to realize their receipts within the extended period. It will also provide greater flexibility <br>to exporters to negotiate future contracts with buyers abroad.<br><br>

<b>2)</b> RBI constituted an <b>advisory committee to review ways and means limits </b>for states and Union Territories (UTs). As per the committee's report, it has been decided to increase the ways and means limit by <b>30% from the existing threshold </b>for all states/UTs. 
The move is expected to cause the relief to state governments to get through the pandemic. The revised limits by the Central Bank came into force with effect from <b>1 April </b>and will be valid till 30 September 2020.<br><br>

<b>3)</b> RBI cancelled the <br>counter-cyclical capital buffer for banks<br> for a period of one year. RBI's framework views the <b>credit-to Gross domestic product (GDP) gap </b>as the main indicator, along with other supplementary indicators. 
The counter-cyclical capital buffer framework was introduced by RBI in 2015. The framework aimed to build up capital that may be used by them to maintain the flow of credit in difficult times. The framework aimed to prevent banks from indiscriminate lending in periods of excess credit growth.</p>
